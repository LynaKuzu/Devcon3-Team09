# GAME: Player Skee-Ball
# GAME: Player [Skee-Ball/Curling]

## Overview 

> What are you making?

We are making a 'Skee-ball'-esque game where the player will control a ball that they load with speed and force before releasinging it, where they will then need to navigate and weave between obstacles to reach the ramp at the end and land in a hole to earn points
We are making a ['Skee-ball'-esque / Curling] game where the player will control a [ball/rock] that they load with speed and force before releasing it, where they will then need to navigate and weave between obstacles to reach the [ramp at the end and land in a hole to earn points / circle and try and stop on the middle]

## Objective Statement 

> What question are you trying to answer with your prototype? Why?

The question we are trying to answer with our prototype is: Will it will be more interesting for players to need to control their skee-balls through a sort of obstacle course through navigating left and right, to be able to reach the holes at the end?

Some games are fun for being mostly mindless, while others are fun for how engaging they are. We want to be able to see which way players feel about Skee-ball, and which version they ultimately prefer.

## Design Rationale 

> What do you envision? How is the game experience informed by metrics? How is it engaging beyond a simulation?

We believe that this more dynmaic and tricky level of control that the player will be presented with will lead to a more interesting and less mindless way to play a game that takes a unique spin compared to how the game is played.

- Curling Stone: a weight between 17.24 and 19.96 kilograms (38 and 44 lb), a maximum circumference of 914 millimetres (36 in), and a minimum height of 114 millimetres (4+1⁄2 in).

- Curling Sheet: 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 m) in length by 14.5 to 16.5 feet (4.4 to 5.0 m) in width.
	- House: A target, the house, is centred on the intersection of the centre line, drawn lengthwise down the centre of the sheet and the tee line, drawn 16 feet (4.9 m) from, and parallel to, the backboard. These lines divide the house into quarters. The house consists of a centre circle (the button) and three concentric rings, of diameters 4, 8, and 12 feet
