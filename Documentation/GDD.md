# GAME: Player Skee-Ball

## Overview 

> What are you making?

We are making a Skee-ball game where the player will control each of their balls and have to properly line up their speed and direction to get into the holes. 

## Objective Statement 

> What question are you trying to answer with your prototype? Why?

The question we are trying to answer with our prototype is: Will it will be more interesting for players to control their skee-balls all the way through rather than a more classic 'aim-and-release' method of play?

 Some games are fun for being mostly mindless, while others are fun for how engaging they are. We want to be able to see which way players feel about Skee-ball, and which version they ultimately prefer.

## Design Rationale 

> What do you envision? How is the game experience informed by metrics? How is it engaging beyond a simulation?

We believe that this more dynmaic and tricky level of control that the player will be presented with will lead to a more interesting and less mindless way to play a game that takes a unique spin compared to how the game is played in real life.
